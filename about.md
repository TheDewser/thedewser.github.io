I have worked in some facet of IT for the last 18+ years. I consider myself a coder of convenience.  But I hope to one day be able to develop simple apps to automate my life so I can do fun things.  Current personal blog can be read at [braindrool.dewser.com](http://braindrool.dewser.com/)

I maintain my professional blog at [Nutmeg InfoSec](https://www.nutmeginfosec.com).  Topics include mostly Information Security.

You can find the source code for Jekyll at
